# Horiseon Code Refactor
___
## Project Goal
Optimize html and css code for search engines by adding accessibility features such as alt text for images and semantic HTML. 
___
## Why This is Necessary
* semantic code looks nicer, is easier to read, and is easier to develop with in the long run
* it is easier to make responsive due to it's file size being lighter than non-semantic code
* search engines give priority to websites that use semantic code, making it easier to be found by customers
